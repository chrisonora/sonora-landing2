  tsParticles Gatsby Landing Page Starter
</h1>

Kick off your project with this landing page boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files, and [React tsParticles](https://github.com/matteobruni/tsparticles) with a simple configuration, you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

## Landing Page Preview

You can see a working preview [here](https://tsparticles.github.io/gatsby-landing-page-starter/index.html)

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the blog starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the particles landing page starter
    gatsby new my-particles-starter https://github.com/tsparticles/gatsby-landing-page-starter
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-particles-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-particles-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── __screenshots
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── static
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package.json
    ├── README.md
    └── yarn.lock

1.  **`/__screenshots**: This directory contains screenshots used in this README, can be removed.

2.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

3.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

4.  **`/static`**: This directory will contain all the images needed to the starter.

5.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

6.  **`.prettierignore`**: This is an ignore file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

7.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

9.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

10.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the MIT license.

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

13. **`yarn.lock`** (See `package.json` above, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**
